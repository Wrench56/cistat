# Welcome to project cistat

cistat is a tool used to generate statistics of your code. The tool comes with a CLI based UI, but you can also use cistat as a library. Although cistat is a python library, it is not meant to be used only for python. I'm planning to add more and more support for different languages overtime. \
P.S.: If you wonder what cistat means, then here is its meaning: Code STATistics
